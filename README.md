## Introduction

In this project, we aimed to harness the power of data to gain a deeper understanding of healthcare articles available on the web. We employed Python, web scraping, and natural language processing tools to collect, analyze, and interpret data from various healthcare sources. Our goal was to uncover sentiment patterns, assess readability, and identify complex linguistic structures within these articles.

## Project Highlights

- **Web Scraping**: We developed a sophisticated web scraping tool to collect HTML content from a wide range of healthcare websites, ensuring a comprehensive dataset.

- **Sentiment Analysis**: We conducted sentiment analysis to determine the emotional tone of healthcare articles. This helped us gauge public perception within the healthcare domain.

- **Readability Metrics**: We analyzed readability metrics to assess the linguistic complexity and structure of articles. This allowed us to categorize articles by accessibility.

- **Open Data Repository**: This repository is designed for public access, promoting transparency and collaboration within the data science community. It serves as a valuable resource for healthcare researchers and enthusiasts.
